###### LeagueHQ is both a message board where League of Legends players can chat with each other about their favorite characters, and a hub for all of the data provided by the API about the game. This includes static data such as each character's abilities, their backstories and their in-game statistics, as well as dynamic data such as detailed information about a user's matches.
